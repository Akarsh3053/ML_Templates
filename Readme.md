# ML templates

Here is the collection of some widely popular machine learning problems and their code, for beginners looking who are looking for some basic projects and notebooks to play around with. Playing with the code and working on something helps in greatly improving you understanding of the concepts as well as lets you have fun while learning all the complicated boring stuff.

All these projects are curated from ML practice problems as well as from various resources which I came across during my learning. So, feel free to suggest some changes or even better if you have something to contribute, I would be happy to click `merge`.
