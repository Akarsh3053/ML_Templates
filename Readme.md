# Machine Learning templates

Here is the collection of some widely popular machine learning problems and their code, for beginners looking for some basic projects and notebooks to play around with. Playing with the code and working on something helps greatly improve your understanding of the concepts and lets you have fun while learning all the complicated boring stuff. These are some basic ones that are like 'Hello World!' to ML so I figured it would be better to put all these together for anyone who is looking for a place to get started.

All these projects are curated from ML practice problems and various resources I came across during my learning. So, feel free to suggest some changes, or even better if you have something to contribute, I would be happy to click `merge`.
